# SÃ¶renssons Army Share Club Portal

## Introduction
My second web project ever. This project is put on ice and unfinished. The purpose of this site was to enable my share club to easily monitor our current portfolio and investigate different investment strategies. I used it to learn basic HTML, JavaScript, jQuery, CSS and PHP.

This website queries Yahoos YML for share information and then displays it on the website. I also started working on basic meeting protocol handling to collect all of our decisions. Information about current portfolios and meeting protocols are stored in a MySQL database.


## Usage
As this project is incomplete, you can only view the main.html file and see some basic functionality. I've removed the database connectivity information.
